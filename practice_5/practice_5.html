        <h3>Shiv Khera</h3>
        <p>Khera was born in a business oriented family that operated 
            coal mines, which were eventually nationalized by the Indian
            government. In his early years, he worked as a car washer, 
            a life insurance agent, and a franchise operator before 
            becoming a motivational speaker. While working in Toronto,
            he was inspired by a lecture delivered by Norman Vincent 
            Peale and claims to follow Peale's motivational teachings.
            When Freedom Is Not Free was published, Amrit Lal, a retired
            Indian civil servant, accused Khera of plagiarism, alleging 
            that content from that book directly came from his own book 
            India Enough Is Enough, published 8 years earlier.Additionally,
            he found that numerous anecdotes, jokes and quotes in Khera's 
            other books were also used without acknowledging proper sources. 
            Khera countered that he took notes and inspirations from numerous 
            sources, and that he was unable to keep track of all of them.
